:transcription: A mystery man, George Annalyn, and I ended up in his lair He must
  be one powerful sorcerer, for this kind of magic is rare Freshly aquafled with pantaloons,
  they did my best to ensure they'd stay on A sudden slash, and a voice that I'd not
  heard before Look up and see that madness is gone I'm Virgil the Hex, I plan this
  ordeal, you've proven your worth, so a door I'll reveal I must be up front, what's
  next will be tough, even the greatest of luck might not be enough You've been lying
  in this room with little to do, but that's gonna change her in a moment or two You
  were selected by me, cause there's something I need, an elaborate plan where you're
  certain to believe I can't do much help, but I'll show you the door, if you're bringing
  my gem, then freedom is yours Across, far beyond this conclave, the spirits are
  frayed, the memories blow out of the way A vengeance burns, for the gem of great
  war, nothing could have stayed in control, within deep in the earth With our magic
  and might, we are going forth, to my loot shop and your soul Up we go, to the labyrinth
  of the unknown I know firsthand his bond is loaded, with deep magic he'd not know
  about His intentions are becoming much clearer now, can we trust he even knows the
  way out? But we just have no choice, besides, it is to be won Great war for blood,
  this power and greed might be all we need And now let's find this gem and be free
  Hex, if he'd learned he'd led us on, the last trick he'd done, he'd surely not have
  you So if we search for this gem, you won't so need, if I've not been freed, you're
  gonna find out those can't flee With our magic and might, we are going forth, to
  the labyrinth of the unknown Now I'm ready to go, beware of your traps, I've chosen
  you both, there's no going back You do as I say, consider it your choice, all of
  my minions must follow my voice I can break down a wall, make great towers topple,
  with a bond in my hand, I nearly unstoppable It's time to depart, I'm infused in
  your eyes, you find in my journey, I just try not to die So we follow as we must,
  no other soul safe for that face of the wall We can trust, if not only just reduced
  to dust, to dust Into the halls, the labyrinth calls, does this freedom have a cost?
  But we were lost, found new cause, just hope we won't be double-crossed Get out
  the room, a place that's new, to let the spirit through and through We watch it
  blaze, and break some dice, whatever's next, burn to the edge Jim, find my Jim Find
  my Jim Find my Jim Find my Jim Find my Jim
